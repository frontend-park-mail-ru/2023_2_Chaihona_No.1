/**
 * The `node:child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in
 * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
 * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
 *
 * ```js
 * const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');
 * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
 *
 * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
 *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
 * });
 *
 * ls.on('close', (code) => {
 *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
 * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
 * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
 * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
 * subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
 * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }`option if the output will not be consumed.
 *
 * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
 * variable if `env` is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
 * used. If `options.env` is set without `PATH`, lookup on Unix is performed
 * on a default search path search of `/usr/bin:/bin` (see your operating system's
 * manual for execvpe/execvp), on Windows the current processes environment
 * variable `PATH` is used.
 *
 * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
 * lexicographically sort
